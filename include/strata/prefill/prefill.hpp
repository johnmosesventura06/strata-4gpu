// include/strata/prefill/prefill.hpp - plan v0.3 P5: batched prompt processing.
//
// The prompt's positions [pos0, pos0 + n) are processed in chunks through all 48 layers, leaving the session state
// (GDN recurrence and conv state, QSA KV pools and indexer, PLE history) where the token path would have left it; the
// decode loop then continues with the next token.  Per layer: the projections are tensor-core GEMMs (quantized
// weights dequantized to FP16 on the fly, BF16 weights as they are) and the recurrences walk the tokens inside one
// kernel, in sub-chunks of up to 2048 tokens whose buffers are reused; the routed experts then run over the whole
// chunk (strata/prefill/experts.hpp), so an expert the cache does not hold is streamed once per chunk.  Long chunks
// cost little VRAM besides the residual stream (~55 KB a token).
//
// Requires the native weights (`--native`): every quantized projection must carry its GGUF blocks.
